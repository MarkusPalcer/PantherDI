# PantherDI

Yet another dependency injection container.

## Motivation

The original motivation to create my own DI-container was to understand how DI-containers work and why they come with the performance impact that they have.
My aim was to learn about DI by trying to create a my own DI-Container and try to keep the performance impact low.

To achieve the first and most important goal and share the gained knowledge I decided to keep a developer diary in my blog. 
I haven't checked yet, whether I achieved the second goal.

**Warning:** This means that this project has been created using explorative programming and it is by no means _made_ for productive use.
One example is that the interface is not as intuitive as I thought. \\
If you plan to use this in a serious project, please read the Dev Diary first, try to understand the code and _then_ decide whether to use this DI-Container or one of the "well established", but also "proven" ones (like Autofac or MEF).

## Dev Diary

The developer diary can be found on my blog (http://markuspalcer.blogspot.de/ ):

PantherDI is still under development and even new features will get blog posts.

## Documentation & Sample

A proper documentation (in the wiki) is still missing and to be honest I'm currently struggling with doing that, so I'd appreciate contributions in that direction.

A sample is planned, I just don't know which of my pet-projects I will use, so it'll be a surprise not just to you but also to me ;)
